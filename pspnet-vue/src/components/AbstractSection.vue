  <p>
    The PSPNet project builds the foundational machine learning tools and
    architecture, interfaced using a web application. The larger project’s goals
    are to present new benchmark datasets for plant and soil properties and
    their effects on wildfire dynamics, and to use state of the art machine
    learning models to address the wildfire problem domain. Currently, our
    project has developed a small example dataset containing 99 images total in
    order to train YOLOv5 and Facebook’s Detectron2 machine learning model.
    Furthermore, we developed a website demonstrating the different
    functionalities of our website to address plant classification: user-related
    pages, an image dataset gallery page, and an image classification page.
