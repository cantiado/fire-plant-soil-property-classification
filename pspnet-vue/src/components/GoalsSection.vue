  <p>
    The overall objectives of this prototype was to implement a functional
    front-end and to implement “toy” machine learning models. The specific
    breakdown of these objectives are described in the following section,
    listing out the significant items completed for each objective. The team
    agreed to first complete a functional front-end for two reasons: (1) the
    team can focus on learning, implementing, and connecting a back-end; and (2)
    the team wanted to take this opportunity to learn web development from the
    beginning. After demonstrating the prototype, the team was alerted of better
    practices for web development which is discussed further in Section 5. With
    the front end, the team agreed to complete the implementation and training
    of a couple “toy” machine learning models for two reasons: (1) to
    demonstrate what models may output, and (2) to have models to later connect
    to the front end. The models were trained on a small dataset of plant images
    to lessen the time cost spent which resulted in varying levels of success in
    detecting sagebrush in the images. The team intends to later retrain these
    models,and implement and test other models on a larger dataset.
