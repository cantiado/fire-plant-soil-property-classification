  <p>
    The current dataset used to train our model is the
    <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://plantnet.org/open-data/"
      >Pl@ntNet-300K data set</a
    >. In the future, we are hoping to receive the specific data set to the
    wildfire research project. However, gathering the data is a labor and time
    insensive project and likely will not be completed in time to train on.
